# Sukodu Brute Force algorithm

This project is an algorithm designed to brute force Sudoku puzzles. It is primarily written in JavaScript, with a touch of HTML and CSS to visualize the algorithm in action. Additionally, the Bootstrap CSS framework is utilized for styling and layout enhancements.

I created this project to challenge my problem-solving skills and to refresh my knowledge of JavaScript concepts I had previously learned.

## Acknowledgements

This isn't my first attempt at creating this algorithm. I previously worked on a very similar project in PHP alongside [Sven Hoeksema](https://github.com/Snevver). However, that project is still unfinished.

I would also like to acknowledge [Alex Janse](https://github.com/alextjanse), who hosted a presentation explaining many of the complex elements involved in this algorithm. Additionally, Alex offered personal guidance and support to both Sven and me during our work.
